    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to use PINNs to solve the fluid flow for the given geometry and flow parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2D chip is placed inside a 2D channel. The flow enters inlet at $u=1.5\\text{ m/s}$ and exits through the outlet which is a $0 Pa$. All the other walls are treated as no-slip. The kinematic viscosity $(\\nu)$ for the flow is $0.02 \\text{ }m^2/s$ and the density $(\\rho)$ is $1 \\text{ }kg/m^3$. The problem is shown in the figure below.\n",

    "## Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "The main challenge in this problem is to correctly formulate the problem using PINNs. In order to achieve that, you will have to complete the following parts successfully:\n",
    "1. Define the correct geometry for the problem\n",
    "2. Set-up the correct boundary conditions and equations\n",
    "3. Create the neural network and solve the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "A successful completion of the problem should result in distribution of flow variables as shown below. Also, you should aim to achieve a relative $L_2$ error of less than 0.2 for all the variables w.r.t the given OpenFOAM solution. \n",

    "Now, define the simulation parameters and generate the geometry. You will be using the 2D geometry modules for this example. Please fill in the appropriate values for each geometry. Remember, `Channel2D` and `Rectangle` are defined by its two endpoints. The difference between a channel and rectangle in SimNet is that, the channel geometry does not have bounding curves in the x-direction. This is helpful in getting a signed distance field that it infinite in x-direction. This can be important when the signed distance field is used as a wall distance in some of the turbulence models (Refer *SimNet User Guide Chapter 3* for more details). Hence we will create the inlet and outlet using `Line` geometry (*Please note that this is a 2d line, as opposed to the* `Line1D` *that was used in the diffusion tutorial*)"
