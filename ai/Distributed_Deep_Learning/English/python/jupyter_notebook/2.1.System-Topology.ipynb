    "In our previous notebook when we calculated the Throughput of deep learning training with different parameters , we saw a slight dip when we scaled from 4 to 8 GPUs , let us try to reason it by understanding the underlying the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, let us define two important terms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Latency:** The amount of time it takes to take a unit of data from point A to point B. For example, if 4B of data can be transferred from point A to B in 4 $\\mu$s, that is the latency of transfer.\n",
    "* **Bandwidth:** The amount of data that can be transferred from point A to point B in a unit of time. For example, if the width of the bus is 64KiB and latency of transfer between point A and B is 4 $\\mu$s, the bandwidth is 64KiB * (1/4$\\mu$s) = 1.6 GiB/s.\n",

    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/memcpy_host_staging.png\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, in the above GPU-to-GPU memory copy, the data traverses from GPU 0 the PCIe bus to the CPU, where it is staged in a buffer before being copied to GPU 1. This is called \"host staging\" and it decreases the bandwidth while increasing the latency of the operation. If we eliminate host staging, we can usually improve the performance of our application.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Peer-to-Peer Memory Access\n",
    "\n",
    "P2P allows devices to address each other's memory from within device kernels and eliminates host staging by transferring data either through the PCIe switch or through NVLink as denoted by the red arrow below. \n",
    "\n",
    "<center><img src=\"images/memcpy_p2p_overview.png\"/></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Peer-to-Peer (P2P) memory access requires GPUs to share a Unified Virtual Address Space (UVA). UVA means that a single address space is used for the host and all modern NVIDIA GPU devices (specifically, those with compute capibility of 2.0 or higher).\n",

The output states that GPUs 1 through 4 are connected to it via NVLink (in addition to PCIe) and GPUs 5 through 7 are connected to it via PCIe as well as an \"SMP\" interconnect. We have a dual-socket system and the CPUs in these sockets are connected by an interconnect known as SMP interconnect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, GPU 0 to GPU 5 communication happens via not just PCIe, but also over the inter-socket interconnect within the same node. Clearly, this is a longer path than say the one between GPU 0 and GPU 1, which are connected via NVLink directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even within the GPUs connected via NVLink, we see different annotations such as `NV1` and `NV2` that affect the communication bandwidth and hence the performance. In this section, we will explore the nuances associated with a diverse intra-node GPU communication topology like in the output above. Specifically, in our system, the communication topology is as follows:\n",

    "Host staging implies traversing through the CPU and the travel path taken is one of PHB, NODE, and SYS. In contrast, if the path taken is either NV1, NV2, or PIX, then P2P is available. PXB implies that the GPUs belong to different PCIe hubs and P2P is usually not supported in this case.\n",

    "* NVLink: Using NV# topology, 50GB/s per connection. So a double NVLink connection has 100GB/s peak bidirectional bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us understand what difference the underlying communication topology can make to the application performance in the following sub-section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** If your command output doesn't show any NVLink connection or if there's no difference in connection type (PIX, PXB, PHB, NODE, SYS, NV#) between any 2 pair of GPUs, then the communication bandwidth and latency will likely be the same between any pair and the following sub-sections will not display any performance difference."
